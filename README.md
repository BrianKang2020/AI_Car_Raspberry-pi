# AI_Car_Raspberry pi

## Introduction
AI_Car_Raspberry-pi is a python progam for making your own AI car based on raspberry-pi.
AI_Car_Raspberry-pi programed based on python 2.7.x and the hardware is raspberry pi 3B plus. In additionï¼Œyou need a USB camera and a usb microphone. Of course, you need a car controlled by a DC motor. <br>
You should be install **[opencv 3.4.x](https://github.com/dalinzhangzdl/AI_Car_Raspberry-pi/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi%203B%2B%20installation%20opencv%20full%20version%20tutorial%20_mumu.pdf)** firstly. <br>
**Raspberry Pi-based artificial intelligence car tutorial__mumu.pdf** is an original Raspberry Pi-based artificial intelligence car tutorial.In this tutorial, you can learn how to use the Raspberry Pi to make your own artificial intelligence car.<br>
You can use the Raspberry Pi to implement image recognition, QR code recognition, speech recognition and speech synthesis, and intelligent driving cars based on artificial neural networks.<br>

## Color and object tracking
In this part, you can master some basic syntax of python-opencv. In addition, learning the conversion of HSV color space and RGB color space to realize some applications of color tracking.<br>

## QR code recognition and tracking
In this part, You can master the technology of QR code recognition with **[ZBAR](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/)** and Raspberry Pi control motor using [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/).<br>
In addition, in this part, you can make a car with functions of cruising line.

## Speech recognition and voice control
In this part, You can master cloud speech recognition and speech synthesis technology, and in order to avoid privacy leaks, I used the [snowboy offline voice wake-up engine](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/).You can make your own voice control car.<br>

## Self-driving trolley based on ANN
In this part, You can master artificial neural network technology and make your own driverless car.
